# Python Data Analysis Tool

This is a simple GUI for data cleaning and exploratory data analysis. It has several features including outlier detection, data visualization, data transformation, missing value handling, duplicate data detection, and other summary statistics. 

Within the file finalProj1.py, there is code for an executable GUI that allows a user to upload a .csv file to be analyzed. Then several functions appear, including an option to save the current data as a new .csv file and the ability to remove the current data and start fresh.
